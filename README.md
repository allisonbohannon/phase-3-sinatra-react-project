# My Reads Flatiron Portfolio Project

## Project Purpose
This project is intended to fulfill the requirements for the Flatiron School Phase 3 project. This repositoryserves as a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React frontend. 

## Project Description
This application allows a user to keep track of their reading list. They can add a book, author, and genre, which will then be added to their "To Be Read" list. Users can delete books from the list, or mark them as read. Books that are marked as read are moved to the Completed Reads list. 

On the backend, there are three separate database tables for Authors, Books, and Genres. Books are connected to Authors and Genres through foreign keys.
